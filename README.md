# This repository is a work in progress!
As of now platform conversion is not done.  
The project is intended for PlatformIO+STM32Cube environments.

## TODO
1. Adapt the timer sublibrary to STM32 platform
2. Adapt GPIO handling
3. Test functionality
4. Create a separate library from the timer sublibrary
5. Adapt STM32Step to use the new timer library
6. Create hardware aided timer library with unchanged API (setup can differ)
7. Measure performance with different timer libs (load, jitter, maximum performance)
